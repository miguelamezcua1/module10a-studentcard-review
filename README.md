# Module 10A – StudentCard Code Review

## Description
This project focuses on reviewing and documenting the StudentCard component. The component displays a student’s information using props and uses state to toggle the bio section.

## What I Learned
- How props are passed into components to display different content.
- How `useState` is used to store and update a value (true/false).
- How to conditionally render JSX elements based on state.
- The importance of writing clear comments to explain logic.

## Challenges
It was a bit tricky to explain `useState` in simple words, but I found that thinking of it as a "variable that makes React re-render when it changes" helped me explain it better.
